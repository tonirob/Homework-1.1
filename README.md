# Homework-1.1
I'm beginning to Git
This practise is about creating repositories.

I create a repository through git init
I add file using git add-
I make changes and I use a git commit -m
Finally, I load the repository file to order a git push

If I want to create a branch for a repository of a student I make a fork
Then I request to send it by a pull request.
